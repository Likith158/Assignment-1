<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>

<p>
    <pre>
    Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers 
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”
•Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer 
program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class 
of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, 
as measured by P, improves with experience E."

        Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or 
no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure 
from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the 
variables.
We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on 
relationships among the variables in the data.
With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the 
prediction results.

        Clustering: 
Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to 
automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar 
or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and 
so on.
Non-clustering: 
The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic 
environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh 
of sounds at a cocktail party.)
